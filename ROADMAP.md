# Floatify Roadmap

This document outlines upcoming development plans for the Floatify library.

## Near Term

- **Stability** – Finalise the API and publish a stable 1.0 release.
- **Notification history** – Provide a panel to browse previous cards.
- **Styling improvements** – Polish the default themes and allow easier customization.
- **Panel triggers** – Offer built‑in icons or links to open the history panel.

## Future Ideas

- Richer interactions inspired by mobile "dynamic island" widgets.
- Animation presets for card transitions.
- Pluggable renderers so cards can display custom content.
- Accessibility improvements and more keyboard navigation options.
- Progress indicators for long running tasks.
- Integration with web notifications for push messages.
